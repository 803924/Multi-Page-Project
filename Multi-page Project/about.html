            <h2>A Breif History of Cross Country</h2>
            <p>Cross Country (abbreviated to CC or XC) originated from the Crick Run held every year since 1838 at</p>
            <p>Rubby School In England. Many other famous schools followed suit in holding annual cross-country races. </p>
            <p>Thirty years later the Thames Rowing Club held cross-country runs and races as a winter sport to condition</p>
            <p>rowers. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Races</h2>
            <p>Races Start in masses, with each team having it's own box/area to along the start. A gun or horn is sounded</p>
            <p>when the race has started. After the first 200 to 300 meters, runners typically fall into their "race pace", or</p>
            <p>a steadier pace that can be maintained for a long period of time. during this, they have to run whithin a marked</p>
            <p>path usally indicated by a long white line telling runners where to go. The final strtch is where the runners go all</p>
            <p>out trying to take as many places as possible. at the finnish line there are helpers to assist the runners who finnished.</p>

            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            <p>When two or more teams compete, a score may be compiled to determine which team wins. points are rewarded to individual</p>
            <p>runners, the score they get is equal to the position they cross the finnish line (first place gets 1 point, second place</p>
            <p>gets two points, ect), and all the points are for a team are summed. Finnaly, teams are ranked based on how many total</p>
            <p>they got, with the least amount of points being the best, and the most being the worst.</p>

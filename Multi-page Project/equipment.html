            <p>Cross Country involves little specialized equipment. Most races are run in shorts and vests in club or school colors.</p>
            <p>If it is cold, long-sleeved shirts, and tights can be worn without losing mobility. The most common foorwear worn are</p>
            <p>called spikes. which are lightweight racing shoes that consist metal spikes called teeth on the bottom to help with traction</p>
            <p>Most teeth are replaceable for spikes, so if the race conditions are muddy, tehn larger spikes may be worn. Some runners</p>
            <p>may prefer to wear flats which are your typical running shoes you would wear when not racing. Flats are useally less</p>
            <p>agressive in foot positioning, amd are heaveir than spikes. they're ideal for races that includes significant amount of</p>
            <p>paved roads which spikes are not goof for.</p>
